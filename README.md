- 👋 Hi, I’m @williamscodebox

I build clean, scalable systems with a focus on developer experience, automation, and rock‑solid TypeScript.  
My happy place is somewhere between **monorepos, Docker, DevOps workflows, and beautifully structured code**.

### 🧠 What I Love
- TypeScript everywhere  
- Clean architecture and maintainable workflows  
- Dockerized environments that “just work”  
- Cross‑platform scripting (PowerShell, Bash)  
- Debugging gnarly issues until everything is ✨ smooth ✨  

### 🛠️ Tech I Use Daily
- **TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, React**
- **Prisma, PostgreSQL, Neon**
- **Docker, DevOps, CI/CD**
- **PNPM, Turborepo, Monorepos**
- **Tailwind, Shadcn, UI systems**

### 📚 Currently Learning
- Advanced monorepo patterns  
- Distributed systems & microservices  
- Production‑grade observability and logging  

### 🤝 Let’s Build Something
I’m always exploring new ideas, refining workflows, and pushing for cleaner, more elegant solutions.  
If you’re into TypeScript, DevOps, or building scalable systems, we’ll get along great.
